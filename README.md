# Movie Industry Metrics Power BI Dashboard
# Problem Statement
This Power BI dashboard offers insights into the movie industry by analyzing metrics such as box office revenue, ratings, genre trends, and awards. It enables users to explore patterns, identify areas for improvement, and understand the factors driving a movie's success. Through the dashboard, users can analyze trends, investigate genre preferences, and evaluate the impact of awards and ratings on box office performance.

### Steps Followed
- Step 1: Load data into Power BI Desktop from CSV files containing detailed information about movies.
- Step 2: In Power Query, enable Column Quality, Column Distribution, and Column Profile for data cleaning.
- Step 3: Replace N/A values with null in columns like Box Office, Released, and Awards to streamline transformations.
- Step 4: Split and categorize awards into General Award Wins/Nominations and Special Awards (such as Oscars, Golden Globes, BAFTAs).
- Step 5: Calculate Total Wins and Total Nominations by aggregating both general and special awards.
- Step 6: Split the genre data into genre_1, genre_2, and genre_3 for detailed analysis, then create a combined genre list for determining the most common genre.
- Step 7: Configure calculated columns and measures:
Created measures for Top 5 High-Grossing Movies, Most Common Genre, and aggregate calculations for Total Wins and Total Nominations.
Applied binning for Box Office Revenue to group movies by revenue range, enabling analysis of distribution across revenue brackets.
- Step 8: Design interactive visuals and add slicers (filters) for Genre, Year, and Rating for user-driven exploration.
- Step 9: Format and organize visuals across multiple pages, creating an engaging, easy-to-navigate dashboard experience.
